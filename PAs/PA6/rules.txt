BATTLESHIP RULES

Be the first to sink all of your opponent's ships!

You and your computer will be placing ships of different sizes on separate ocean grids (boards).

You'll alternate turns with your computer, choosing one shot per turn to try to hit each other's ships.

When every cell of a ship has been hit, that ship will sink.
