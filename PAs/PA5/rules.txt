Yahtzee is a dice game that was invented by Milton Bradley and Edwin S. Lowe in 1956.
The challenge of the game is to outduel the other player by scoring the most points.

Points are obtained by rolling 5 6-sided dice across thirteen rounds.
During each round, each player may roll the dice up to 3 times to make one of the scoring combinations.
Once a combination has been achieved by the player, it may not be used again in future rounds,
except for the Yahtzee combination may be used as many times as the player makes the combination.

Each scoring combination has different point totals.
Some of these totals are achieved through the accumulation of points across rolls,
and some are obtained as fixed sequences of values.

The scorecard used for Yahtzee is composed of 2 sections: an upper and a lower section.
A total of 13 boxes or 13 scoring combinations are divided amongst the sections.

The upper section consists of boxes that are scored by summing the value of the dice matching the faces of the box.
If a player rolls 4 3's, then the score placed in the 3's box is the sum of the dice which is 12.
Once a player has chosen to score a box,
it may not be changed and the combination is no longer in play for future rounds.
If the sum of the scores in the upper section is >= 63,
then 35 points are added to the player's overall score as a bonus.

The lower section contains a number of poker-like combinations:
